# Mechanical fits calculator 

This project intends to be a quick reference for fits and limits in mechanical design. To do that, the module ```mechanicalFits.py``` provides a function called ```Tolerance```. This function returns a band of tolerance when given basic size, fundamental deviation, and international tolerance grade as arguments.
