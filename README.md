# Mechanical fits calculator 

This project intends to be a quick reference for fits and limits in mechanical design. To do that, the module ```mechanicalFits.py``` provides a function called ```Tolerance```. This function returns a list that shows the band of tolerance (in Î¼m) when given basic size (in mm), fundamental deviation, and international tolerance grade as arguments.

Also, there's a file called ```Engineering_tolerancings.ipynb``` that contains a theorical overview of engineering toleracing and two fits calculators, one for preferred metric fits and another one for specific metric fits.
